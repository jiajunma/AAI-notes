# Fractional Field

## Motivation

**Ring of integers**  
ℤ is an integral domain

**Field of rational numbers**  

$ℚ = \{a/b : a ∈ ℤ, 0 ≠ b ∈ ℤ\}$

## Goal

Extend the construction to any integral domain:

Let $D$ be an integral domain. Construct a field $F$ such that $D \subset F$.

---
## Construction
Let $D$ be an integral domain.
Define the set of **fractions**:
$$Q(D) := \{(a, b) : a, b \in D, 0 \neq b\} / \sim$$
where
$$(a,b) \sim (c,d) \Leftrightarrow ad = bc.$$

---


## $\sim$ is an Equivalence Relation

We need to verify that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $Q(D)$.

**Reflexivity**: $(a,b) \sim (a,b)$
- We need to show $ab = ba$, which holds by commutativity.

**Symmetry**: $(a,b) \sim (c,d) \Rightarrow (c,d) \sim (a,b)$
- If $ad = bc$, then $cb = da$ by commutativity.

**Transitivity**: $(a,b) \sim (c,d)$ and $(c,d) \sim (e,f) \Rightarrow (a,b) \sim (e,f)$

Thus $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

---

# To simplify notation, write $a/b$ for the equivalence class $(a,b)$.

---
# Addition

$a/b + c/d := (ad + bc) / bd$


## Addition is well-defined:
 if $(a,b) \sim (a',b')$ and $(c,d) \sim (c',d')$, then $(ad + bc) / bd \sim (a'c' + b'c') / b'd'$.

**Proof:**
Assume $(a,b) \sim (a',b')$ and $(c,d) \sim (c',d')$.

By definition of $\sim$:
- $ab' = ba'$ 
- $cd' = dc'$ 

---
# Multiplication
$a/b \cdot c/d := (ac) / (bd)$

## Multiplication is well-defined:
 if $(a,b) \sim (a',b')$ and $(c,d) \sim (c',d')$, then $(ac) / (bd) \sim (a'c') / (b'd')$.

---
# zero element in $Q(D)$

$0/1$ is the zero element in $Q(D)$.

Now
$a/b = 0/1 \Leftrightarrow a = 0$.

---

# Identity element in $Q(D)$

## $1/1$ is the identity element in $Q(D)$:

 $a/b \cdot 1/1 = (a \cdot 1) / (b \cdot 1) = a/b$.

* Note that $a/a = 1/1$ for every $a \neq 0$.
---

# Units in $Q(D)$

If $a\neq 0$. Then 
$(a/b) \cdot (b/a) = (a \cdot b) / (b \cdot a) = 1/1$.

Thus, every non-zero element in $Q(D)$ has a multiplicative inverse, making $Q(D)$ a field.

---
# Distributive Law
$(a/b) \cdot (c/d + e/f) = (a/b) \cdot ((cf + de)/(df))$
$= (a/b) \cdot (c/d) + (a/b) \cdot (e/f)$

---
# Example 

* $D = ℤ$, then  $Q(D) = \{a/b : a, b ∈ ℤ, 0 ≠ b\} = \mathbb{Q}$

* Field of rational functions:
$F$ is a field, $D = F[x]$, 
then $Q(D) = F(x)$ is the field of rational functions in $x$ with coefficients in $F$.

---
# Natural embedding

There is a natural embedding of $D$ into $Q(D)$:
$$
\pi : D \rightarrow Q(D) \quad  
d \mapsto d/1
$$

- This is a ring homomorphism.
- This is an injection: 
$\mathrm{Ker} \pi = \{0\}$. 


---
# Universal Property of fractional field 

Let $K$ be a field and $D$ be an integral domain.

For every injective ring homomorphism $f : D \rightarrow K$, 
there exists a unique ring homomorphism $\tilde{f} : Q(D) \rightarrow K$ such that $\tilde{f} \circ \pi = f$.


# Proof
Define $\tilde{f} : Q(D) \rightarrow K$ by 
$\tilde{f}(a/b) := f(a)/f(b)$. 

---
# Fact: All non-zero homomorphisms from a field to other ring are embeddings. 

Suppose $f : K\to R$ is a homomorphism from a field $K$ to a ring $R$. 

$f \neq 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{Ker} f = \{0\} \Rightarrow f$ is an embedding.


---
Upshot:

$Q(D)$ is the smallest field containing $D$.

---
# Field of Rational functions


Let $F$ be a field and $F[x]$ be the polynomial ring over $F$.

The **field of rational functions** $F(x)$ is defined as the fractional field of $F[x]$:

$$F(x) := Q(F[x]) = \left\{\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} : p(x), q(x) \in F[x], q(x) \neq 0\right\}$$



---
# Laurent power series:

$F$ is a field, $D = F[[x]]$, 
 is the ring of formal power series in $x$ with coefficients in $F$.

# Theorem 
$Q(D[[x]]) = F((x))$ is the field of Laurent power series in $x$ with coefficients in $F$.

# Gauss integers

---

The **Gaussian integers** are defined as:

$$\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $i^2 = -1$.

## Properties

- $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is an integral domain
- $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$ (the complex numbers)
- Addition: $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i$
- Multiplication: $(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$

---

## Fractional Field

The fractional field of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is:

$$Q(\mathbb{Z}[i]) = \mathbb{Q}(i) = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}$$

This is the field of **Gaussian rationals**.

## Proof:
$\langle \mathbb{Z}[i],\mathbb{Q}\rangle = \mathbb{Q}[i]$. 

---
# Property of gauss integer


## Norm 

For a Gaussian integer $z = a + bi \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$, the **norm** is defined as:

$$N(z) = N(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2 = z \cdot \overline{z}$$

where $\overline{z} = a - bi$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.

### Properties of the Norm

1. **Multiplicativity**: $N(zw) = N(z) \cdot N(w)$ for all $z, w \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$

2. **Non-negativity**: $N(z) \geq 0$ for all $z \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$, and $N(z) = 0$ if and only if $z = 0$

3. **Integer values**: $N(z) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ for all $z \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$


---
# Euclidean domain definition 

A **Euclidean domain** is an integral domain $D$ equipped with a function $\nu: D \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{N}$ (called a **Euclidean function**) such that:

For any $a, b \in D$ with $b \neq 0$, there exist $q, r \in D$ (not assume unique) such that:
$$a = qb + r$$
where either $r = 0$ or $\nu(r) < \nu(b)$.

## Examples of Euclidean domains:

1. **Integers**: $\mathbb{Z}$ with $\nu(n) = |n|$ (absolute value)
2. **Polynomial rings**: $F[x]$ over a field $F$ with $\nu(p) = \deg(p)$ (degree)
3. **Gaussian integers**: $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $\nu(z) = N(z) = a^2 + b^2$ (norm)

---

## Properties (we will discuss these properties later):

- Every Euclidean domain is a **principal ideal domain (PID)**
- Every Euclidean domain is a **unique factorization domain (UFD)**
- The Euclidean algorithm can be used to compute GCD in Euclidean domains

---
# Theorem 
If $E$ is a Euclidean domain then $E$ is a PID. 


**Proof**:

Let $0 \neq I \subset E$ is an ideal. 
We need to show that $I$ is principal.

Among all non-zero elements in $I$, choose an element $a$ such that $\nu(a)$ is minimal.

---

We claim that $I = (a)$.

**Step 1**: Clearly $(a) \subseteq I$ since $a \in I$ and $I$ is an ideal.

**Step 2**: To show $I \subseteq (a)$, let $b \in I$ be arbitrary.

Since $E$ is a Euclidean domain, we can apply the division algorithm:
$$b = qa + r$$
where $q, r \in E$ and either $r = 0$ or $\nu(r) < \nu(a)$.

Note that $r = b - qa \in I$ (since $b \in I$, $a \in I$, and $I$ is an ideal).

Claim $r \neq 0$. Otherwise $\nu(r) < \nu(a)$, which contradicts the minimality of $\nu(a)$ among non-zero elements in $I$.

---
## Irreducible element in an integral domain    


A non-unit element $r \in D$ is called **irreducible** if whenever $r = ab$ for some $a, b \in D$, then either $a$ or $b$ is a unit.
(equivalently, either $a$ or $b$ is divisible by $r$)

**Equivalently**: $r$ is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two non-unit elements.

**Examples**:
- In $\mathbb{Z}$: prime numbers are irreducible elements
- In $\mathbb{Z}[i]$: $1+i$ is irreducible since $N(1+i) = 2$ is prime in $\mathbb{Z}$

---
## Unit in Gauss integer

**Theorem**: The units in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are exactly $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$.

Proof: They are all norm $1$ elements. 

---

## irreducible element in Gauss integer

Lemma: If $N(r)$ is a prime number, then $r$ is irreducible. 


---
## irreducible element in PID


**Theorem**: Let $D$ be a PID, $0 \neq p \in D$. Then the following statements are equivalent:

a) $D / (p)$ is a field

b) $D / (p)$ is an integral domain

c) $p$ is irreducible.

Proof: a) => b) by every field is an integral domain. 

---
Proof: b) => c) 
If p=ab, then (a+(p))(b+(p)) = (p). Since $D/(p)$ is integral, a + (p) = (p) or b + (p) = (p), which means $p|a$ or $p|b$. 

---
Proof: c) => a)

Want to show $(p)$ is a maximal ideal. 

Use $D$ is PID. Every ideal $I$ has the form $(a)$ for some $a\in D$. 
If $(p) \subset (a)$ then $p=ab$ for some $b$. 

Then 
- either $a$ is unit => $(a)=D$.
- or $b$ is unit => $(p) = (a)$. 

---
# Gauss integer is a Euclidean domain 

**Theorem**: $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain with the norm function $N(z) = a^2 + b^2$ as the Euclidean function.

**Proof**: We need to show that for any $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $\beta \neq 0$, there exist $q, r \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that:
$$\alpha = q\beta + r$$
where either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(\beta)$.

Consider the quotient $\alpha/\beta \in \mathbb{Q}(i)$. We can write:
$$\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = x + yi$$
where $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$.

---
Choose integers $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $|x - m| \leq 1/2$ and $|y - n| \leq 1/2$.

Let $q = m + ni \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $r = \alpha - q\beta$.

Then:
$$\alpha = q\beta + r$$

We need to verify that $N(r) < N(\beta)$:

$$r = \alpha - q\beta = \beta\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta} - q\right) = \beta((x-m) + (y-n)i)$$

Therefore:
$$N(r) = N(\beta) \cdot N((x-m) + (y-n)i) = N(\beta) \cdot ((x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2)$$

Since $|x-m| \leq 1/2$ and $|y-n| \leq 1/2$:
$$(x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2 \leq \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} < 1$$

Thus:
$$N(r) = N(\beta) \cdot ((x-m)^2 + (y-n)^2) < N(\beta)$$

This completes the proof that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Euclidean domain. ∎

# Applications of Gaussian Integers

## Fermat's Theorem on Sums of Two Squares: 
A prime number $p$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if $p = 2$ or $p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.


**Example**: 
- $5 = 1^2 + 2^2 = (1+2i)(1-2i)$
- $13 = 2^2 + 3^2 = (2+3i)(2-3i)$
- But $3$ cannot be written as sum of two squares (it's prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$)


---
# Prove using Gauss integer. 

=> 
If $p=a^2 + b^2$ then $p \equiv 1 (mod 4)$ 

WLOG : $a = 2k+1$ and $b=2l$ then the equation is clear. 

---

If $p \equiv 1 (mod 4)$, then 
exits $c$ such that $c^{(p-1)/2} = -1$ since $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ is a cyclic group.

Or by quadratic reciprocity. 

---

Now 
- $p | c^2 + 1 =  (c-i)(c+i)$ 
- $p \not\mid c-i$ 
- $p \not\mid c+i$ 

This implies $(p)$ is not a prime ideal. 

$\Rightarrow$ $p$ is not irreducible.  

$\Rightarrow \exists \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $p = \alpha \beta$  and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ non-unit. 

$\Rightarrow$ $p = N(\alpha) = c^2 + d^2$ if $\alpha = c + di$.
