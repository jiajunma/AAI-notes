Let $(G, H)$ be a dual pair in $Sp(\mathbb{W})$. This chapter gives a very detailed and systematic treatment of the problem of splittings of $G$ inside the metaplectic $C^1$-cover. The authors develop the necessary framework and case-by-case arguments to describe the splitting. The exposition is technically heavy but very well organized. I found no mathematical errors or language problems. 

Here is a list of minor expository improvements that would increase clarity:

p. 306, l. −10: The sentence “we already know that in this case the splitting is unique” should be accompanied by an explicit reference to an earlier result in the book.

p. 323, Lemma 11.24: Introduce the setting before the lemma—specifically define the spaces \mathbb{X} and \mathbb{X}′ used in the statement first.

Notation $\mathrm{diag}_W$: The symbol $\mahtrm{diag}_W$ is potentially misleading because it suggests dependence only on $W$. Consider renaming it to $\mathrm{diag}_{W,W′}$  or simply $\mathrm{diag}$. 

p. 327: When $V=0$, it would be helpful to the readers to include an explanation: what compatibility condition is being imposed and why that leads naturally to the chosen formula for the splitting.
